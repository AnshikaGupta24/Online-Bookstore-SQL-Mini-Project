# üìö Online Bookstore SQL Project
This mini SQL project involves performing structured queries on an online bookstore database to extract meaningful business insights. The project showcases the use of SQL operations such as JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and aggregate functions to analyze key metrics like book sale and inventory trends.
It serves as a practice project to strengthen my data analysis and database querying skills using real-world e-commerce data.

## üìÅ Dataset Overview
The project uses 3 CSV files that simulate a relational bookstore database:

‚Ä¢ customers.csv

Contains customer-related information:
customer_id, name, city, country

‚Ä¢ orders.csv

Tracks purchase transactions:
order_id, customer_id, book_id, quantity, total_amount

‚Ä¢ books.csv

Contains book and inventory details:
book_id, title, author, stock_quantity

These files were imported into a relational SQL database and linked using foreign keys (customer_id, book_id) to run various queries.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
‚Ä¢ MySQL

‚Ä¢ SQL Workbench (optional GUI client)

‚Ä¢ Sample bookstore dataset (relational schema)
